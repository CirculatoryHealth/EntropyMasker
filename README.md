# Reproducibility

This project uses the Workflow for Open Reproducible Code in Science (WORCS) to
ensure transparency and reproducibility. The workflow is designed to meet the
principles of Open Science throughout a research project. 

To learn how WORCS helps researchers meet the TOP-guidelines and FAIR principles,
read the preprint at https://osf.io/zcvbs/

## WORCS: Advice for authors

* To get started with `worcs`, see the [setup vignette](https://cjvanlissa.github.io/worcs/articles/setup.html)
* For detailed information about the steps of the WORCS workflow, see the [workflow vignette](https://cjvanlissa.github.io/worcs/articles/workflow.html)

## WORCS: Advice for readers

Please refer to the vignette on [reproducing a WORCS project]() for step by step advice.
<!-- If your project deviates from the steps outlined in the vignette on     -->

Dr. Sander W. van der Laan is funded through grants from the Netherlands CardioVascular Research Initiative of the Netherlands Heart Foundation (CVON 2011/B019 and CVON 2017-20: Generating the best evidence-based pharmaceutical targets for atherosclerosis [GENIUS I&II]). We are thankful for the support of the ERA-CVD program ‘druggable-MI-targets’ (grant number: 01KL1802), the EU H2020 TO_AITION (grant number: 848146), and the Leducq Fondation ‘PlaqOmics’.

Plaque samples are derived from carotid endarterectomies as part of the [Athero-Express Biobank Study](http:www/atheroexpress.nl) which is an ongoing study in the UMC Utrecht.

The framework was based on the [`WORCS` package](https://osf.io/zcvbs/).
