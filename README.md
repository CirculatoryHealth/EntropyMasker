## EntropyMasker

<!-- Please add a brief introduction to explain what the project is about    -->

[add in decription]

### Where do I start?

**`EntropyMasker`** is dependent on `python3`. You can run it locally or through a high-performance compute cluster (HPC). <!-- We created
detailed instructions in the wiki to install the necessary
`python`-libraries.-->

To run `EntropyMasker` run the following code:

    python EntropyMaster/entropyMasker.py --input_img --output_img

| Flag              | Required/Optional | Description                                    |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `-i/--input_img`  | required          | complete path to the whole-slide image to mask |
| `-o/--output_img` | required          | complete path to the masked output-image       |
| `-h/--help`       | optional          | to get a usage-description                     |

## Data availability

The whole-slide images used in this project are available through a [DataverseNL repository](https://doi.org/10.34894/QI135J "ExpressScan: Histological whole-slide image data from the Athero-Express (AE) and Aneurysm-Express (AAA) Biobank Studies"). There are restrictions on use by commercial parties, and on sharing openly based on (inter)national laws, regulations and the written informed consent. Therefore these data (and additional clinical data) are only available upon discussion and signing a Data Sharing Agreement (see Terms of Access) and within a specially designed UMC Utrecht provided environment.

## Acknowledgements, disclosures, and funding

We are thankful for the support of the Netherlands CardioVascular Research Initiative of the Netherlands Heart Foundation (CVON 2011/B019 and CVON 2017-20: Generating the best evidence-based pharmaceutical targets for atherosclerosis [GENIUS I&II]), the ERA-CVD program 'druggable-MI-targets' (grant number: 01KL1802), and the Leducq Fondation 'PlaqOmics'.

Funding for this research was provided by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant nos. R00HL125912 and R01HL14823 (to Clint L.

Plaque samples are derived from carotid endarterectomies as part of the [Athero-Express Biobank Study](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10564-004-2304-6) which is an ongoing study in the UMC Utrecht. We would like to thank all the (former) employees involved in the Athero-Express Biobank Study of the Departments of Surgery of the St. Antonius Hospital Nieuwegein and University Medical Center Utrecht for their continuing work. In particular we would like to thank (in no particular order) Marijke Linschoten, Arjan Samani, Petra H. Homoed-van der Kraak, Tim Bezemer, Tim van de Kerkhof, Joyce Vrijenhoek, Evelyn Velema, Ben van Middelaar, Sander Reukema, Robin Reijers, JoÃ«lle van Bennekom, and Bas Nelissen. Lastly, we would like to thank all participants of the Athero-Express Biobank Study; without you these studies would not be possible.
