### Description

**`EntropyMasker`** is a fully automated approach for separating foreground (tissue) and background in bright-field microscopic whole-slide images of (immuno)histologically stained samples. This method is unaffected by changes in scanning or image processing conditions, by using a measure of local entropy and generating corresponding binary tissue masks.


### Scientific abstract

**Background:** Tissue segmentation of histology whole-slide images remains a critical challenge in digital pathology for both disease diagnosis and phenotyping for research purposes. When the tissue structure of a specimen is relatively porous and heterogeneous, such as for atherosclerotic plaques, precise tissue segmentation is essential for a correct interpretation. 

**Method:** In this study, we developed a unique approach called **`EntropyMasker`** based on statistical analysis and binary morphology to tackle the issue of fore- and background segmentation (masking) in histopathological [whole-slide images (WSIs)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32452840/), which has yet to be solved. 

**Results and conclusion:** We tested our system on large extracts from 97 high-resolution WSIs of hematoxylin and eosin and 8 other staining types on atherosclerotic plaques from the [Athero-Express Biobank Study](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10564-004-2304-6) each with different staining quality and acquired under different imaging settings. We compared our method with four other widely used methods and found that our method had the highest sensitivity and [Jaccard similarity index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index). We envision a positive impact of **`EntropyMasker`** to WSI-preprocessing in image analyses for disease phenotyping beyond the field of atherosclerosis. 

### Where do I start?

**`EntropyMasker`** is dependent on `python3`. You can run it locally or through a high-performance compute cluster (HPC). <!-- We created
detailed instructions in the wiki to install the necessary
`python`-libraries.-->

To run `EntropyMasker` run the following code:

    python EntropyMaster/entropyMasker.py --input_img --output_img

| Flag              | Required/Optional | Description                                    |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `-i/--input_img`  | required          | complete path to the whole-slide image to mask |
| `-o/--output_img` | required          | complete path to the masked output-image       |
| `-h/--help`       | optional          | to get a usage-description                     |

### Data availability

The whole-slide images used in this project are available through a [DataverseNL repository](https://doi.org/10.34894/QI135J "ExpressScan: Histological whole-slide image data from the Athero-Express (AE) and Aneurysm-Express (AAA) Biobank Studies"). There are restrictions on use by commercial parties, and on sharing openly based on (inter)national laws, regulations and the written informed consent. Therefore these data (and additional clinical data) are only available upon discussion and signing a Data Sharing Agreement (see Terms of Access) and within a specially designed UMC Utrecht provided environment.
